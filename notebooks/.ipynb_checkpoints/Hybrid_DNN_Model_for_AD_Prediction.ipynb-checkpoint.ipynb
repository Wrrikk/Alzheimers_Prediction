    "# Hybrid DNN Model for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that represents a significant and growing global health challenge. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for management and treatment planning, but it remains a complex task due to the multifactorial nature of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we develop a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) model aimed at predicting the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. The \"hybrid\" aspect of the model refers to its combination of high-capacity deep learning techniques with feature importance analysis, leveraging both data-driven predictions and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this project are:\n",
    "- To build a robust predictive model capable of identifying patterns associated with AD progression using patient data.\n",
    "- To utilize feature importance analysis, specifically through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to gain insights into which features contribute most significantly to the model's predictions.\n",
    "- To evaluate the model's performance through rigorous metrics, ensuring its reliability and applicability in a clinical setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook, we document the entire process from data preprocessing, model construction, and training to the interpretation of the model outputs. Our approach underscores the importance of not only predictive accuracy but also the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models in healthcare.\n"

    "## Analysis of K-Fold Cross-Validation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "The model achieved an exceptionally high average accuracy of 99.67% with a very low standard deviation of 0.18% across all folds. This indicates a highly effective model with consistent performance across different subsets of the data. The average loss was remarkably low at 0.01, further confirming the model's efficacy in accurately predicting Alzheimer's Disease from the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- **High Accuracy**: The high average accuracy suggests that the model is very effective at classifying the correct stages of Alzheimer's Disease. The low variability (standard deviation) in accuracy across folds underscores the model’s stability and robustness, which are crucial for clinical applications.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Low Loss**: The minimal loss indicates that the model’s predictions are very close to the actual data, showcasing the model's ability to generalize well without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "These results validate the model's reliability and suitability for potentially aiding in the diagnostic process of Alzheimer's Disease. Given its high accuracy and low loss, it could be considered for further validation with external datasets or potentially in clinical trials to assess its practical utility in a real-world setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistent performance across different data splits suggests that the model could reliably be used in diverse clinical scenarios without the risk of significant performance drops.\n"

    "\n",
    "Understanding the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions is crucial, especially in healthcare applications where interpretability can inform clinical decisions. We employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a game theory approach to explain the output of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explainer Setup\n",
    "- **Background Data**: A subset of the training data (`X_train`) is used to initialize the SHAP explainer. This subset is sampled to include 100 instances, providing a representative background for the model's data distribution.\n",

    "### Calculate SHAP Values\n",
    "- **Subset Sampling**: SHAP values are computed for a randomly sampled subset of 100 instances from the test dataset (`X_test`). This approach ensures that the explanations are manageable and computationally feasible while still providing insight into the model's behavior on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization of SHAP Values\n",
    "- **Summary Plot**: The SHAP summary plot provides a global view of the feature importances. It shows how much each feature contributes to increasing or decreasing the prediction output. The features are ranked by their importance, and their impact distribution across the dataset is displayed.\n",
    "- **Feature Names**: Custom feature names (`new_features`) are used in the plot to clearly identify each feature, enhancing the interpretability of the plot.\n",

    "## Insights from SHAP Summary Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHAP summary plot provides a visual representation of feature importances for the Alzheimer's Disease classification model. Each row corresponds to a feature, and the color-coded segments represent the impact of these features on the model's output across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cognitive Test Scores**: Features such as `CDRSB.bl`, `MMSE.bl`, and `ADAS13.bl` are prominently placed at the top of the plot, indicating their significant influence on the model's predictions. These features, associated with cognitive test scores, are crucial for understanding the disease's impact on cognitive functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class-Differential Impact**: The spread of colors across the bars for each feature illustrates that the influence of certain features varies by class. For instance, `CDRSB.bl` shows a marked impact on Class 0 and Class 3, suggesting its relevance to the early and possibly intermediate stages of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biomarkers**: Anatomical features such as `Hippocampus.bl` and `Fusiform.bl` also demonstrate substantial importance. The hippocampus, known to be affected in Alzheimer's Disease, is validated by the model as a significant feature, aligning with current medical understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variability in Influence**: The variability of feature impact across classes highlights the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's Disease and reinforces the need for a nuanced approach to diagnosis and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential for Clinical Application**: The diversity and strength of feature importance offer insights that could be leveraged for clinical applications, such as targeted screening and personalized treatment plans based on patient-specific profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The model identifies a range of features with varying degrees of importance, reflecting the complex interplay of cognitive, genetic, and neuroanatomical factors in Alzheimer's Disease. This analysis underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing our understanding and prediction of the disease, though clinical validation remains essential to ensure relevance and accuracy.\n"
